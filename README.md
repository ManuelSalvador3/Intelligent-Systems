Project developed by Manuel Salvador and Daniel Sabag as part as Intelligent Systems subject.

This desktop app is able to reproduce a video that the user chooses and from that video it will take out the audio and convert it into .wav file, then it will translate the sound from the video to text. With this text we are able to apply different codes in relation to different actions that a driver does while in the car.

This "codes" can be applied by clicking the button on the bootom left corner that says "Sugerir codigos". This will apply all the codes that the program founds. 

When ever the user wants, he can modify the text shown in screen so he can correct any mistakes the translator do.
